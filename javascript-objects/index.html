            Once upon a time, there was a <span id="a1"></span> year old person named <span id="n1"></span>, who lived with their <span id="a2"></span> year old parent, <span id="n2"></span>. One day
            the two of them decided to go adventuring in the woods until they were attacked by <span id="b1"></span> and <span id="b2"></span>! They unfortunately did not survive. The end.
